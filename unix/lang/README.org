Some hints: 

- Every build is a debug build, typically like: ./configure CFLAGS="-g -O2" && make

- To compile with profiling information: export CFLAGS="-pg --coverage" ; ./configure ; make
  - Then run yabasic as normal: ./yabasic tests/common/speed-yab
  - Run gprof: gprof ./yabasic
  - Or run gcov: gcov main.c
  - WARNING: adding "--coverage" to CFLAGS slows down yabasic by a factor of 3 or more
  
- To compile with address sanitizer:
  - make sure that clang and llvm are installed
  - ./configure CC=clang CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g -O0"
  - make

- To apply changes in configure.ac
  - autoconf
  - If this doesn't help, try autoreconf -i

- For first build after a fresh checkout from github

  If you just want to build yabasic:
  - ./configure

  If you want to adjust the built-process, run these too:
  - aclocal
  - autoconf
