* Some hints

  - Every build is a debug build, typically like: ./configure CFLAGS="-g -O2" && make

  - To compile with profiling information: export CFLAGS="-pg --coverage" ; ./configure ; make
    - Then run yabasic as normal: ./yabasic tests/common/speed-yab
    - Run gprof: gprof ./yabasic
    - Or run gcov: gcov main.c
    - WARNING: adding "--coverage" to CFLAGS slows down yabasic by a factor of 3 or more

  - To compile with address sanitizer:
    - make sure that clang and llvm are installed
    - ./configure CC=clang CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g -O0"
    - make

  - To apply changes in configure.ac
    - autoconf
    - If this doesn't help, try autoreconf -i

  - For first build after a fresh checkout from github

    If you just want to build yabasic:
    - ./configure

    If you want to adjust the built-process, run these too:
    - aclocal
    - autoconf

* On colors in the console/terminal/screen

  For linux-compatibility yabasic adheres to the color-model used in ncurses under
  linux. This applies to its console-output on any platform (even windows).

  Details can be found at: https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/about-ncurses-colors-0

  In short, yabasic has 8 foreground-colors (black, red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, magenta,
  white) and 8 background colors.
