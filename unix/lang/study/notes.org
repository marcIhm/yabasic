* [2024-12-28 Sat] Error messages after curinit() should switch of curses first

  Code looks right, behaviour not.

  Puzzling:

  - Artifical error "thud" in initcol
  - Some sleeps to make sequence of things easier visible 
  - Should trigger printf in this sequence (according to code):
    - foo0, foo1, foo2 in error_with_position
    - qux0, qux1 in show_and_mark_line
  - However the sequence on screen is:
    - foo0 in curses
    - qux0, qux1 out of curses
    - foo1, foo2 out of curses
  - Maybe threading-error ? Which threads ?


  ./configure CFLAGS="-g -O0" && make

  gdb setup:

  break main.c:2055
  break main.c:1961
  tty /dev/pts/3
  run study/colors.yab
