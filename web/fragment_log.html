	<li><b>2.69 (30 June 2001):</b> 
	  <ul type="circle">
            <li>Implemented <b>logical shortcuts</b>, i.e. conditions within if 
              or while statements are only evaluated as far as needed. 
            <li>New form of the open statement: o<b>pen &quot;foo&quot; for reading 
		as #1</b> 
            <li>New form of the open function: open(a,&quot;foo&quot;) intended 
              for use in if-statements: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>if (not open(a,&quot;foo&quot;)) 
		print &quot;Shit !&quot; 
            </b><li>You may now write: a=open(&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;w&quot;):print #a 
              &quot;Hello&quot; 
	  </ul>
	<li><b>2.68 (2 March 2001): </b>Essentially removed the distinction between 
	  <b>expressions</b> and <b>conditions</b>, i.e. you may write things like 
	  this:&nbsp;okay=(1&lt;10) : if (okay) print &quot;Hallo&quot; 
	<li><b>2.66 (7 January 2001): </b>Modified <b>instr()</b> to accept an optional 
	  third argument and <b>mid$()</b> to go without its third argument. Added 
	  the <b>rinstr()</b>-Function. Added the <b>bin$()</b> function to convert 
	  decimal into binary numbers and extended <b>dec()</b> to do the other way 
	  around; fixed some errors related with int()/hex() and large numbers. 
	<li><b>2.65 (21 October 2000): </b>You may specify the directory to search 
	  libraries with the new option <b>librarypath</b>. The <b>seek()</b> function 
	  might now be used within conditions to check for success e.g.: &nbsp;if 
	  (!seek(1,20)) error &quot;Shit !&quot;. <br> Added the command <b>compile</b> 
	  and the function <b>execute()</b> to create code on the fly and to call 
	  a subroutine, whose name is only known at runtime only. E.g. use <b>compile 
	    &quot;sub foo(a):print a:end sub&quot;</b> to create subroutine <b>foo</b> 
	  on the fly and use <b>execute(&quot;foo&quot;,2)</b> as an alternate way 
	  to say <b>foo(2)</b>. 
	  <ul type="disc">
            <li>Release 3: Fixed a bug with the <b>system()</b> function as reported 
              by <b>Michael Cwickel</b>: Some strange problems with <b>scrolling</b> 
              under windows surfaced within the system() function, which did not give 
              correct output in some cases. Corrected some problems with using <b>arraydim()</b> 
              and <b>arraysize()</b> within subroutines as reported by <b>Arnand Roques.</b> 
              
	  </ul>
	<li><b>2.64 (15 June 2000):</b> Rewrote the functions <b>token()</b> and 
	  <b>split()</b> and even changed their grammar. This change will affect existing 
	  yabasic-programs, if they use those functions ! 
	  <ul type="disc">
            <li>Release 5: Fixed an error with <b>numparams</b> (which contains 
              the number of parameters passed to a function). 
            <li>Release 4: Reintroduced the <b>token$()</b> and <b>split$()</b> 
              functions, fixed a compile problem under <b>AIX</b> and made <b>Pi</b> 
              and euler available within libraries. 
	  </ul>
	<li><b>2.63 (10 April 2000):</b> Made the graphic window <b>repaint</b> 
	  itself under Unix, so a covered window will not loose its contents; made 
	  the inkey$ function recognize the state of the <b>shift</b> key, if a mousebutton 
	  is pressed within the graphic window; Removed an error which <b>freezes 
	  </b>yabasic after opening a window under some Unix systems. A special <b>poke</b> 
	  makes the input statement return nonprintable characters. A bug related 
	  with <b>restore</b>/labels and <b>Subroutines</b> has been fixed. 
	<li><b>2.62 (21 January 2000): </b>Extended the domain of the **-operator, 
	  as suggested by <b>Albert Beissel</b>. Corrected the resolution-pattern 
	  for non local variables, thanks to <b>Tom Ellestad</b>. Added the <b>-e</b> 
	  option, which allows one to execute yabasic code on the fly. Options may now 
	  be abbreviated. 
	<li><b>2.61 (29 Dezember 1999):</b> Besides printing grafics, yabasic is 
	  now &nbsp;able to print pure text and listst. You may <b>clear</b> and <b>fill</b> 
	  circles, rectangles, lines and dots &nbsp;in a simple manner. Bitmanipulation 
	  with the new &nbsp;functions &nbsp;<b>and(), or(), eor(). </b>You may move 
	  around within an open file with<b> seek </b>and<b> tell(). </b>Fixed a nasty 
	  bug with <b>local</b> variables, which has been detected by <b>Tom Ellestad. 
	  </b>Bugfix for <b>peek$(&quot;library&quot;)</b>, thanx again to <b>Tom 
	    Ellestad</b> !

	  (i.e. map(),mapx(),mapy(), arrow and marker) has been <strong>removed</strong>.

	  and <tt>inkey$</tt>. 
	<li>Implemented an <tt>INKEY$</tt>-function, which allows yabasic-programs 
	  to receive any pressed key without waiting for a newline. 
	<li>Windows: Improved search for default-printer, so that I could get a 
	  printout even under Windows NT. 
	<li>Unix: Introduced comment-lines that start with a hash ('#'), allowing 
	  the usual Unix-convention for specifying the interpreter (e.g. #!/usr/bin/yabasic); 
	  thanx to Ken Jordan, who suggested this useful feature. 
	<li>Windows: Changed the icon to something more meaningful. 
	<li>A serious bug in the <tt>close</tt>-statement has been fixed. 
	<li>Random numbers can be generated, e.g. <tt>ran(12)</tt>

	  (e.g. \n, \a, \t) are processed in any string. 
	<li>To make the build-process more reliable, I try using the GNU-autconf 
	  package. Hope, this will fix some mysterious problems, I heard of before. 
	  
	<li>During the last change I introduced a bug in the str$()-function, making 
	  it expect strings instead of numbers as arguments. This bug has been fixed. 
	  
	<li>Simplified internal handling of functions and arrays. This had no impact 
	  on the language, except, that some errors have been introduced and removed 
	  during the process. 
	<li>Unified printing under Unix and Windows, added internal variables. 
	<li>Windows: Fixed an old, but nasty bug in the installation-program, which 
	  caused strange mixing of pathnames on some systems. Added writing of an 
	  installation-log, allowing (hopefully !) better remote-diagnostics. 
	<li>Windows: Added yabasic to the root menu, fixed some bugs in setup. 
	<li>Unix &amp; Win95: Allowed for negative steps in For-Next-Loops (at last 
	  !). 
	<li><b>Switched to Version 2.0</b> 
	<li>Ported to Windows and changed the name to <b>yabasic</b> (&quot;yet 
	  another basic&quot;). 
	<li>The <tt>wait</tt>-command has been changed to accept fractional delays 
	  (e.g. <tt>wait 0.2</tt>). 
	<li>Fixing the last bug, I intoduced another one, which made it impossible 
	  to parse an expression like <tt>a=-b</tt>. This has been corrected. 
	<li>Fixed an old bug: In earlier versions yabasic accepted only positive 
	  constants on <tt>data</tt>-lines and as <tt>step</tt>-part of a <tt>for-next</tt>-loop. 
	  
	<li>Implementation of <tt>circle</tt>-command. 
	<li><b>Switched to Version 1.2</b> 
	<li>Introduced choice of grafics font. 
	<li>Added postscript-support. 
	<li><b>Switched to Version 1.1</b> 
	<li>Some sort of memory leak has been closed; in fact, no memory has been 
	  freed at all ! This problem has been fixed, so that even heavy string-arithmetics 
	  should not lead to memory-problems any longer. 
	<li>The commands pause (or wait) and bell have been implemented. 
	<li>The compilation has become more simple by using xmkmf. 
	<li>The for-next-loop has been changed, so that only a number will be accepted 
	  as step-part. 
	<li>There have been difficulties on some systems in the case of colour resources. 
	  Ron Nicholson has given me a hint to avoid this problem. 
	<li><b>April 1995: Initial Version 1.0 </b>(0.01 would have been better 
	  :-) 
      </ul>
