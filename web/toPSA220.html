<h1>toPSA220.pl a perl-script to load the Nike/Philips MP3 Player under Linux</h1>
<p><b>Version 2.72, &nbsp;November 22, 2005</b></p>
<p>The script <b>toPSA220.pl</b> is intended to load the <b>Nike/Philips 
MP3-Player PSA 220</b> (and probably 250) from your <b>Linux</b> system. It&nbsp;generates 
playlists for a set of mp3-files and stores them within the internal database 
(which will be overwritten). The mp3-files must already be present within the 
directory <font face="Courier New">_system/media/audio</font>.</p>
<p><b>A note for users of the previous versions. Version 2.0</b> creates a playlist 
for every subdirectory of <font face="Courier New">_system/media/audio</font>. 
Other than previous versions, it does not move any files into <font face="Courier New">_system/media/audio</font>. 
In fact, it completely ignores any mp3-files within this directory, it only 
goes for subdirectories. Those subdirectories and the files within however, 
are slightly renamed to generate&nbsp;good names for the individual playlists.</p>
<p><b>toPSA220.pl</b> uses the program <a href="http://www.sqlite.org" target="_parent">sqlite</a> 
to 
accomplish its tasks, which is a  great piece of free software.</p>
<p>Many thanks to <b>Nike</b> and&nbsp;<b>Philips</b>, who created such a nice 
device, especially for runners like me ! </p>
<p>Now you may just as well go and <a href="download/toPSA220.tar.gz">download the tar-file toPSA220.tar.gz</a> 
(894 kByte, including the binaries of sqlite for linux and cygwin)  unpack it and copy the directory tools onto 
your PSA220; just put <b>tools</b> directory side by side to the already existing 
directory <b>_system</b>. </p>
<p>The directory <b>tools</b> contains a README.txt and an INSTALL.txt, so anyone who 
is able to mount his PSA on his Linux box, should have no difficulties. <br>However, 
if there are any problems, suggestions and maybe even a little bit of feature 
creap, just drop me a <a href="mailto:mail@yabasic.de">mail</a> ....</p>
<p>The script toPSA220.pl might be distributed under the terms of the <b><a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a></b>.</p>
<p>For more information, I will finally simply reproduce the message, that you 
get when invoking <b>toPSA220.pl --help</b> :</p>

      Create playlists for Phillips/Nike MP3 PSA 220/250 Player, based on the    
      directory structure in _system/media/audio.

      The files and subdirectories in this directory will have their names 
      modified in order to shorten them (e.g. spaces removed, common chars 
      at both ends deleted). This might not be, what you expect.

  options:    

      -help     : Display this message.
      -all sort : Take the existing playlists in alphabetical order
                   to form the playlist ALL. This is the default.
      -all ask  : Ask the user, in which order the existing playlists
                   should go into ALL-
      -repeat   : Number of times, the Text between playlists in
                   Playlist ALL should be repeated (default: 1).

  Some remarks concerning the playlist ALL:

     The special playlist ALL will be constructed by concatenating either:
       -- All playlists in alphabetcial order, or
       -- Only selected playlists in specified order,
     as specified by the option -all.

     The contents, sequence and duration of the playlists 
     within ALL are written to the file all.txt within the
     audio directory.

     Optionally you may create a directory _Numbers as a subdirectory 
     of audio, and place files named Playlist.mp3, 1.mp3, 2.mp3 ...
     therein. These files would contain the spoken words &quot;Playlist&quot;, 
     &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot; and so on, and may be obtained from 
     http://www.naturalvoices.att.com/demos/ or similar sites.
     These files will then be used to mark the beginning of each
     seperate playlist within the playlist ALL.
