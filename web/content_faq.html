<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>Here are some of the most common questions along with answers. This Faq is 
  still short, but expected to grow on your input.</p>
<p><b>Question:</b> Does yabasic still run under Windows XP ?<br>
  <b>Answer:</b> Yes. Yabasic and its setup program work well under Windows XP too.
  Please note however, that you need to download the zip-file.
</p>
<p><b>Question:</b> Does yabasic run under Wine ?<br>
  <b>Answer:</b> Yes. People have successfully installed the Windows-Version of yabasic under
  wine. Note however, that there is also a native linux-Version of yabasic.
</p>
<p><b>Question: </b>Can yabasic generate stand-alone programs, which may run 
without the yabasic executable ?<br> <b>Answer: </b>No. Yabasic does not translate 
its input into assembly, you always need the yabasic executable. On the other 
hand: the yabasic executable is rather small (&lt;200 kB), so you might spread 
it around with your yabasic programs.</p>
<p><b>Question: </b>May I charge for my yabasic programs ?<br> <b>Answer:</b> 
Yes, you may. But you should state clearly, that yabasic itself is available 
free of charge. Refer to the <a href="copyright.html" target="_self">copyright</a> 
for details.</p>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have just typed in my yabasic program; How &nbsp;do I 
<b>save</b> it ?<br> <b>Answer:</b> You cannot save it. Yabasic has no builtin 
editor and cannot save the text you have typed in ! You have to use another 
editor (e.g. Notepad under Windows) to create and save your yabasic programs. 
Details on how to do this can be found in the <a href="yabasic.htm" target="_self">documentation</a> 
of yabasic.</p>
<p>Under Windows you May proceed like this:
<ul>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Click with the right mousebutton on your desktop. 
        <li>Choose &quot;<strong>new/Yabasic Program</strong>&quot; from the 
        context-menu that appears. 
        <li>This will create a new icon on your desktop and you may change its 
        name as usual. 
        <li>The context-menu (i.e. the menu that appears, if you press the right 
        mousebutton) of this icon has three entries &quot;<strong>Execute</strong>&quot;, 
        &quot;<strong>Edit</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>View docu</strong>&quot;.
        <li>If you choose &quot;<b>Execute</b>&quot; (or just doubleclick the 
        icon) your yabasic program will be executed.
        <li>If you choose &quot;<b>Edit</b>&quot; the notepad editor will be 
        invoked to edit your program; don't forget to save it !
        <li>Finally &quot;<strong>View docu</strong>&quot; shows the embedded 
        documentation, if your program contains any 
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>As an alternative you may use <b>yabedit</b>, which gives you all the comfort 
you might expect.</p>
