<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>Here are some of the most common questions along with answers. This FAQ is 
  still short, but expected to grow on your input.</p>
<p><b>Question:</b> Does Yabasic still run under Windows XP?<br>
  <b>Answer:</b> Yes. Yabasic and its setup program work well under Windows XP too.
  Please note however, that you need to download the zip-file.
</p>
<p><b>Question:</b> Does yabasic run under Wine?<br>
  <b>Answer:</b> Yes. People have successfully installed the Windows version of Yabasic under
  Wine. Note however, that there is also a native Linux version of Yabasic.
</p>
<p><b>Question: </b>Can Yabasic generate stand-alone programs, which may run 
without the Yabasic executable?<br> <b>Answer: </b>No. Yabasic does not translate 
its input into assembly, you always need the Yabasic executable. On the other 
hand: the Yabasic executable is rather small (less than 200 kB), so you can spread 
it around with your yabasic programs.</p>
<p><b>Question: </b>May I charge for my Yabasic programs?<br> <b>Answer:</b> 
Yes, you may, but you should state clearly, that Yabasic itself is available 
free of charge. Refer to the <a href="copyright.html" target="_self">copyright</a> 
page for details.</p>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have just typed in my Yabasic program; How do I 
<b>save</b> it?<br> <b>Answer:</b> You cannot save it. Yabasic has no built-in 
editor and cannot save the text you have typed in! You have to use another 
editor (e.g. Notepad under Windows) to create and save your Yabasic programs. 
Details on how to do this can be found in the <a href="yabasic.htm" target="_self">documentation</a> 
of Yabasic.</p>
<p><b>Question:</b> Does Yabasic handle unicode?<br> <b>Answer:</b> No, the internals of Yabasic can handle only 8-Bit characters and are therefore limited to what can be done in one of those encodings, e.g. iso8859-p1. Changing this would require quite a significant effort.</p>
<p><b>Question:</b> What does the name <b>Yabasic</b> mean?<br> <b>Answer:</b> <b>Yabasic</b> stands for <b>yet-another-basic</b>, an acronym aiming at the large number of different basic-dialects available, when Yabasic had been created.</p>
