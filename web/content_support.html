<h1><a name="whatsnew">Support</a></h1>
<p>First of all, have a look at the <a href="http://www.yabasic.de/yabasic.htm" target="_self">Manual 
of Yabasic</a>&nbsp;!</p>
<h2>What is in the Manual</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.yabasic.de/yabasic.htm" target="_self">Manual 
of Yabasic</a> describes all the features and properties of yabasic in great 
depth and extent. It is packed with examples and it should contain everything 
to get you up and going with yabasic. </p>
<h2>If the manual is not enough</h2>
<p>If you still have trouble with yabasic, you may send me a <a href="mailto:mail@yabasic.de">mail</a> 
or browse the <a href="faq.html" target="_self">faq</a>.</p>
<p>If you have problems <b>compiling</b> yabasic under <b>Unix</b>, you should 
add the file <b>runme.log</b> , which is created by the <b>runme</b>-script 
and contains all the information needed to pin down the error.</p>
<p>If you have <b>trouble</b> with some yabasic-<b>command</b> or <b>program 
</b>, you should create a minimum sample program to reproduce the error; please 
keep this sample program as small as possible. Then and send 
it to  me and add a short description of you problem, containing: 

<ul>
    <li>Which Operating system are you using: Windows (7, 8, vista or xp) or Unix (linux, 
    solaris, ...) ? 
    <li>How does the program behave on your computer ? What did you expect ? 
    
    <li>Which version of yabasic are you using ? Please try the latest one !</ul>
