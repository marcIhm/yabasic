<h1><a name="upgrading">Upgrading from an earlier&nbsp;Version</a></h1>
<p>There is <b>no special procedure necessary</b> to upgrade from a previous 
Version of yabasic. </p>
<p>So, If you already have yabasic installed, or if you do a fresh install, 
just follow the instructions given below.</p>
<h1><a name="binwin">Binaries for Windows</a></h1>
<p>Yabasic runs under any version of Windows; this is how to install: 
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Download <a href="download/yabasic-2.769-setup.exe">yabasic-2.769-setup.exe</a>; save it on your harddisk. 
    <li>double-click on the file 
    <li>follow the instructions 
</ul>
<p>The setup-program does the following: 
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Make an entry in the start-menu 
    <li>Register the extension &quot;.yab&quot; 
    <li>Make an entry in the Root-Menu (this is the menu, which appears if you 
    click the right Mousebutton on an empty part of your Desktop) 
    <li>Put default-settings into the registry 
    <li>Register its uninstall-program 
    <li>Write a complete installation-log in Windows/Temp/yabasic.log 
</ul>
<p>To <b>remove</b> yabasic, go to the control-panel and click on the software-icon: 
You will find an entry for deleting yabasic. </p>
<p>If anything goes wrong please give me a mail:&nbsp;<adress><a href="mailto:mail@yabasic.de">mail@yabasic.de</adress></a>&nbsp; 
</p>
 <h1><a name="binlin">Binaries for Linux</a></h1>
<p>This is how to get the redhat package of yabasic for linux-i586: 
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Click here to download <a href="download/yabasic-2.769-1.i586.rpm">yabasic-2.769-1.i586.rpm</a>, the redhat package of yabasic. 
    <li>Type <strong>rpm -i --force --nodeps FILE </strong>(where FILE is the 
    full name of the file you have just downloaded); the <strong>--force</strong> 
    switch causes <strong>rpm</strong> to superseed an existing (older) version 
    of yabasic. <strong>--nodeps</strong> is necessary, because my version of 
    rpm (2.5.5) introduces some silly dependencies; hope I will be able to fix 
    this soon. You need to be <strong>root</strong> to do this. 
    <li>Read the documentation under /usr/doc/yabasic 
    <li>or try the demos under /usr/share/yabasic 
    <li>to remove yabasic type <strong>rpm -e --allmatches yabasic</strong> 
    ; again this can only be done as root. 
</ul>
<p>This binary distribution can be installed under Linux with an Intel CPU and 
rpm (the redhat package manager) only. If your system doesn't match these requirements, 
or if you want to see the sources you may download them from <a href="download.html#sourceunix">this 
page.</a> </p>
<p>If you have any problems, please drop me a mail:&nbsp;<adress><a href="mailto:mail@yabasic.de">mail@yabasic.de</adress></a>.</p>
<h1><a name="sourceunix">Compile the sources for Unix</a></h1>
<p>Compiling yabasic requires a decent C-Compiler, the ncurses-library and the 
X-Window libraries. To compile yabasic in your home-directory proceed like this: 

<ul type="disc">
    <li>Click here to download <a href="download/yabasic-2.769.tar.gz">yabasic-2.769.tar.gz</a>, the tar-file of yabasic. 
    <li>Uncompress the tar-file: <b>gunzip FILE </b>(where FILE is the full 
    name of the file you have just downloaded). 
    <li><b>tar xf yabasic-x.xxx.tar</b>, this unpacks the tar-file, giving you 
    a directory named <strong>yabasic-x.xxx</strong> (where x.xxx is the current 
    version of yabasic) 
    <li><b>cd yabasic-x.xxx</b> 
    <li><b>runme</b>, this starts a shell script which builts the executable 
    program. (Alternatively you may type: <b>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; 
    make check</b>) 
    <li>If you have root privileges, you may try <strong>make install</strong> 
    to install yabasic in your system. 
</ul>
<p>Yabasic needs the X and ncurses libraries to compile. Yabasic compiles under 
HPUX and linux, but chances are high, that users of other mainstream Unixes 
will have no problems. If anything goes wrong please give me a mail:&nbsp;<adress><a href="mailto:mail@yabasic.de">mail@yabasic.de</adress></a>, 
including: 
<ul type="disc">
    <li>the sort of <b>system</b> you are working on and 
    <li>the file <b>runme.log</b> which is written during execution of the script 
    <b>runme</b> 
</ul>
<p>I will try to find and fix the problem.</p>
<h1><a name="sourcewin">Sources for Windows</a></h1>
<p>If you'd like to get the Windows specific files (including the sources of 
the installation program), you may download <a href="download/yabasic-2.769-src.zip">yabasic-2.769-src.zip</a>. This file does not contain the sources for yabasic itself (only the 
project files), so in addition you will have to download the <a href="#sourceunix"
 target="_self">sources for unix</a> (there is no difference between Unix and 
Windows sources) and import them into the project. To compile yabasic you need 
MS Visual C++, Version 6.0.</p>
<p>If anything goes wrong please give me a mail:&nbsp;<adress><a href="mailto:mail@yabasic.de">mail@yabasic.de</adress></a></p>
<h1><a name="older">Older Versions</a></h1>
<p>As I do not clean up my homepage very often, there may be older versions 
available within the <a href="download">download</a> area.</p>
