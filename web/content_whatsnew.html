    <p>
      Yabasic is a traditional basic-interpreter. It comes with goto and various loops and
      allows to define subroutines and libraries. It does simple graphics and printing.
      Yabasic can call out to libraries written in C and allows to create standalone programs.
      Yabasic runs under Unix and Windows and has a comprehensive documentation; it is small,
      simple, open-source and free.
